<blockquote>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
    leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
    unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
    of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
    recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
    including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</blockquote>
